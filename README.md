# Cricket league mod menu source 

# i added bypass of cricket league 
# bypass for floating window 

# this source is completely based on dobbyhook.
# we didn't use any kittymemory, substrate, a64hook or mshook.

# i made a new simple hooking in this by dobbyhook 
# this hooking is similar to marcos hooking but more smooth and optimise
# i added best encryption to encrypt offset and lib.

# game : cricket league
# version: 1.29.4
# arm : 64
